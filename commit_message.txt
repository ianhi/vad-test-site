feat: Create static VAD test site for GitHub Pages

This commit sets up a simplified, single-version VAD test page, ready for deployment as a static site.

It includes:
- A new `vad-test-site` directory, initialized as a git repository.
- A streamlined `index.html` that exclusively uses the stable `0.0.22` version of the VAD library, removing the multi-version comparison and advanced settings for clarity.
- A GitHub Actions workflow file (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) to automatically build and deploy the site to GitHub Pages.
- A `README.md` with clear instructions for running the site locally using a simple Python web server.
- The `patth.wav` audio file for out-of-the-box testing.

This provides an easy-to-share, public-facing tool for demonstrating and testing the VAD's functionality.
